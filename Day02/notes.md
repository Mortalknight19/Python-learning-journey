I learned the basic instruction of git yesterday.
Today I reviewed some of the git basic instruction I learned yesterday.
So make a conclusion
Although I learned it yesterday,the effort of doing it again today is not satisfactory for me.
But here's the good news
I learned how to creat file by openinng terinmal
Now let's talk about sad things
One
I forgot  that the commod to put a file from workplace into the staging area requires a space after add and then a period. 
TWO
I forgot that how to modify a file and put it form workplace into stating area again.   The answer is #vi file.a#
Three
I forgot to add an alias before the command when making an alias command 
Four
The situation of Three also occurs when the vision rollback(git reflog) instruction is done.
Last
I believe I can do better next day
